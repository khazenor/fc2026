  "description.utilitix.advanced_brewery": "The Advanced Brewery can modify potions. Just like a regular brewery it requires \u00a76Blaze Powder\u00a7r to work. It has four modes:\n- Brewing\n- Merging\n- Upgrading\n- Cloning",
  "description.utilitix.advanced_brewery.brewing": "In \u00a7lBrewing Mode\u00a7r, one \u00a79Awkward Potion\u00a7r is required in the center potion slot and a special ingredient is required in the input slot. You can view brewing recipes in JEI.",
  "description.utilitix.advanced_brewery.merging": "In \u00a7lMerging Mode\u00a7r, two \u00a79Awkward Potions\u00a7r on the outer potions slots are merged and a new potion is created that has their effects combined. The center potion slot must contain a glass bottle and the ingredient slot must be empty. The more complex the resulting potion is, the more likely the merge will fail, resulting in a failed potion.",
  "description.utilitix.advanced_brewery.upgrading": "In \u00a7lUpgrading Mode\u00a7r, a potion with exactly one effect can be upgraded. The resulting potion will have the amplifier increased by one. This works up to amplifier III. The potion to upgrade goes into the center potion slot and a \u00a7lPopped Chorus Fruit\u00a7r has to be filled into the ingredient slot.",
  "description.utilitix.advanced_brewery.cloning": "In \u00a7lCloning Mode\u00a7r, a potion can be duplicated. For this, place the potion to be duplicated in the center potion slot and two \u00a79Water Bottles\u00a7r in the outer potion slots. Then put some \u00a7lNetherite Scrap\u00a7r into the ingredient slot.",
  "description.utilitix.comparator_redirector": "If a \u00a7cComparator\u00a7r is placed next to a \u00a7cComparator Redirector\u00a7r, it will read the comparator output of the block above or below respectively. By this you can read the filling state of a Chest from below it. However you can't chain these.",
  "description.utilitix.weak_redstone_torch": "The $cWeak Redstone Torch\u00a7r works exactly like a regular \u00a7cRedstone Torch\u00a7r with the sole exception that it does not power the block above strongly. So you can still read the signal from that block but only with a Repeater or a Comparator. This also means that this torch is not affected by Torch burnout.",
  "description.utilitix.tiny_coal": "Tiny Coal smelts exactly one item.",
  "description.utilitix.hand_bell": "A bell for your hand. Ringing it will highlight raiders as with a normal bell",
  "description.utilitix.mob_bell": "This special bell can be bound to a mob by shift right-clicking on that mob. Ringing a bound mob bell will highlight mobs of that type.",
  "description.utilitix.failed_potion": "A failed potion is sometimes the result when merging potions in an \u00a7cAdvanced Brewery\u00a7r. The chance for Failed Potions increases with complex merges. Upon drinking, you'll be granted some negative effects.",
  "description.utilitix.armed_stand": "An Armor Stand with arms. You can cycle through different poses by shift right-clicking it with a \u00a78Flint\u00a7r.",
  "description.utilitix.glue_ball": "\u00a7aGlue Balls\u00a7r can be attached to the sides of solid blocks. These blocks will get sticky and pull adjacent blocks when moved by a piston.",
  "description.utilitix.linked_crystal": "You can link up to 16 \u00a7cRedstone Crystals\u00a7r together by right-clicking with them. Then you can put them in \u00a7cLinked Repeaters\u00a7r to get wireless redstone. This also works across dimensions. Right-clicking a bound crystal will show the current signal strength.",
  "description.utilitix.linked_repeater": "\u00a7cLinked Repeaters\u00a7r are like Repeaters with a delay of one tick. However they can take \u00a7cLinked Redstone Crystals\u00a7r to allow for wireless redstone.",
  "description.utilitix.minecart_tinkerer": "The \u00a7lMinecart Tinkerer\u00a7r can be used to add labels to Minecarts and some types of rails. A label is just an item that identifies a minecart. Left-click a minecart to set a label. To add a label to a rail that supports labels, shift right-click that rail with a minecart tinkerer. An example for such a rail is the \u00a7lFilter Rail\u00a7r. Some other rails such as \u00a7lController Rails\u00a7r also have other options you can toggle. For this just right click the rail instead of shift right-click.",
  "description.utilitix.highspeed_rail": "Works like a Powered Rail but is much faster. However they can't make slopes.",
  "description.utilitix.directional_rail": "Minecarts on these rails start moving on their own. Also this rail only lets minecarts pass in one way.",
  "description.utilitix.crossing_rail": "Let two of your minecart tracks cross without ugly bridges.",
  "description.utilitix.filter_rail": "A \u00a7lFilter Rail\u00a7r can filter minecarts based on their label. You can set a label with a \u00a7lMinecart Tinkerer\u00a7r (shift right-click). Then all minecarts with the same label will go sideways, all other minecarts will go straight.",
  "description.utilitix.reinforced_rail": "As normal rails almost instantly reset the speed from highspeed rails to the speed of \u00a7lPowered Rails\u00a7r, you can use \u00a7lReinforced Rails\u00a7r to keep that speed in corners. However like Highspeed Rails, these can't make slopes.",
  "description.utilitix.ender_cart": "A Minecart with an Ender Chest.",
  "description.utilitix.piston_cart": "This cart can place and replace rails. It has an inventory where you can put the new rails on the left and take out the replaced rails on the right. You can also add redstone torches that are placed below the track to power the rails if they can be powered.",
  "description.utilitix.piston_controller_rail": "A rail to control Piston Minecarts. You can set labels with a \u00a7lMinecart Tinkerer\u00a7r (shift right-click) and set the mode that should be set to each Piston Minecart travelling over the block. These rails are not replaced by Piston Minecarts.",
  "description.utilitix.stonecutter_cart": "The Stonecutter Cart can break blocks. By right-clicking, you can change the position of the saw. It will always break the block that the saw is facing. Also it will stop its movement while breaking a block and continue with its old speed when done. However you can't just build static block breakers with this as it will never break a block at the same position two times in a row. The drops of the blocks are always placed on the track so you can pick them up with a Hopper Minecart.",
  "description.utilitix.anvil_cart": "The Anvil Minecart will take care of entities blocking the track. It will push entities from the track so other minecarts can safely pass. It will also transform roughly a quarter of a heart of damage when pushing entities.",
  "description.utilitix.crude_furnace": "This Furnace smelts everything a normal furnace can smelt if the Smoker and Blast Furnace \u00a7lcannot\u00a7r smelt this item. It is twice as fast as the normal Furnace recipe but only provides the half experience.",
  "description.utilitix.mob_yoinker": "The \u00a7lMob Yoinker$r uses your XP to catch mobs into the Cage. It requires as much XP points as the mob has health points.",
  "message.utilitix.mob_yoinker": "You need %s more xp %s to yoink this mob.",
  "message.utilitix.map_save_command": "Something went wrong saving the map. More information in the log.",
