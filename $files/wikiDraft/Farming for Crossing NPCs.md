As you complete quests in the modpack you will be given opportunity to move in villagers

# Move in a villager
- complete the quests required for them to move in
- find their invite quest in the "Villager Move-in" quest chapter
- use that quest to move them in

# purchasing items from Npc
- right clicking the villager at first will make the npc talk to you
- right clicking again you will be able to see what is for sale
- some villagers will have different item for sale after an amount of time. Those trades will update every 10 mins (e.g. Sam will sale different bobbers every 10 mins)
- all villagers with the same name will sale the same sets of items (e.g. if you have multiple copies of a villager summoned they will have the same trades at the same time)

# purchasing decorations/outfits you already own
- after after getting the "village capacity permit" in a quest, you will get access to the "decoration catalog"
- right clicking a villager you move in after the higher village capacity with the catalog will set the trade of the npc to the items you have in your inventory that that npc sells
