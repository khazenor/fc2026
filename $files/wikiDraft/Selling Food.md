# Selling Food
- As you collect more meals, they will be added to your menu
- The more meals you collect, the more your meals will be worth in tickets!
- When you right click a customer (farming crossing npcs) with a menu, they will request a meal off of your menu
- After that you can right click the menu to see which customer is requesting which meal
- You can have multiple request from multiple customers at the same time!
- If you have multiple copies of the same Farming Crossing NPC spawned, they will act like the same customer (as in you can request a dish from sam#1 and deliver it to sam#2)
# Menu right click gui:
- top left (with the roast chicken): number of meals the player has collected so far
- top right (with the tickets): how many tickets the player will receive for delivering each meal to the villagers.
- The bottom: shows which villager is requesting which food.
- Tip: You can add the food items to your JEI bookmarks by pressing 'a' while hovering over a dish!
