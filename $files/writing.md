# Catching Fishes
** your phone rings **
Hello. This is Sam the Osprey. I'm somewhat of a connoisseur of aquatic life, both in terms of natural history and consumption.  My life revolves around fish - I'm a sushi chef by day and a fisherman by night.

Jess told me that you are working on the new Adventurer's Settlement and that you have taken quite a liking to fishing!  I'm very glad to hear that! I'll guide you through some fishing steps and even send some packages your way to help on your settlement quest.

== MODPACK TUTORIAL ==
## Catching Fishes
- This modpack has the Tide mod installed and there is a mini game for fish catches.
- Hold right click with a fishing rod to wind up your fishing rod
- Releasing right click will cast the rod
- When a fish bites, a moving target appears.
- Right click again with the target as close to the center as possible.
- The closer to the center, the higher chance you will actually catch the fish.

# Earning a Profit
** Jess the Beaver **
As you go on your adventures, you'll find fishes, minerals, flora, and even observe some local wildlife! Filling out the dex in your quest book will get you compensation in the form of Miles Tickets.  Keep them save! They are as good as gold!

There are other ways you can get tickets as well.  I know Sam the Osprey exchange them for fishes and all of the people you invite through the Adventurers Settlement package are happy to pay you tickets for a well cooked meal after you have made up a menu!

The uses of tickets are endless!  All of us have wares for sell in exchange for them and of course the material loan from Jess Inc. will be paid off with them as well.

Keep your eyes peeled, and you're bound to find nature's bounty on every branch and bough. Once you pick one - you'll be hooked! As for me, I'm happy just keeping them all for myself. Ha!

# Observing Animals
** Your phone rings **
G'day, I'm Andre the Dog! I've been farming since I was old enough to fill a trough. I'm retired now, but I must say, I'm enjoying it well enough. No losing sleep over managing the farm. No need to worry about logistics, the weather... I can focus my full attention on training my animals. The other day, I taught my chicken Bessie to roll over. She's a smart one, that hen. I even have time to help out at the Oyster Creek Zoo every now and then.

# Mining Minerals
** Your phone rings **
Hi, hi! I'm Laly, Laly the Meerkat! I'm a geologist who loves caving, and a curator of the Oyster Creek Museum's gems and minerals exhibit. I spend A LOT of time underground. It's my happy place. But lately I haven't been able to get out in the field as much as I'd like, since work at the museum has been picking up. I was sooo jealous when Jess told me where she sent you. Lucky you! Turns out, the land is an absolute treasure trove for gems. Since you'll be finding a ton of gems while you mine, you wouldn't mind sending me some specimens for science, right? I can't wait to see what you find!

Hi there, human!  I'm Pamela the Rabbit, hobbyist gardener and head chef of the Carrot Place! Jess told me you are aspiring to be a great chef one day - that's wonderful! I'd be delighted to help you get started.

# Designing Your Own Menu
** Pamela the Rabbit **
I see you are coming along great with learning the cooking basics! Once you have learned 5 meals, we can start crafting a menu together.  I bet all the villagers in the Adventure's Settlement would be excited to try out dishes you have just learned!

== MODPACK TUTORIAL ==
## Selling Food
- As you collect more meals, they will be added to your menu

- The more meals you collect, the more your meals will be worth in tickets!

- When you right click a customer (farming crossing npcs) with a menu, they will request a meal off of your menu

- After that you can right click the menu to see which customer is requesting which meal

- You can have requests from multiple customers at the same time!

- If you have multiple copies of the same Farming Crossing NPC spawned, they will act like the same customer (as in you can request a dish from sam#1 and deliver it to sam#2)

## Menu right click gui:
- top left (with the roast chicken): number of meals the player has collected so far

- top right (with the tickets): how many tickets the player will receive for delivering each meal to the villagers.

- The bottom: shows which villager is requesting which food.

- Tip: You can add the food items to your JEI bookmarks by pressing 'a' while hovering over a dish!
