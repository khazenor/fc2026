Hi, it's me! Jess the Beaver!  It was great speaking with you earlier about our new Adventurers Settlement package!  I am very glad you have agreed to find a good location for a settlement and develop the land.  In return Jess incorporated will loan you building material for settlement at zero interest. But enough of the business talk!  I'm sure you'l find all kind of thrills and delights are you explore the land!  Get yourself started with a crafting table on a stick and I'll send over some basic starting gear for you!

As you go on your adventures, you'll find fishes, minerals, flora, and even observe some local wildlife! Filling out the dex in your quest book will get you compensation in the form of Miles Tickets.  Keep them save! They are as good as gold!

There are other ways you can get tickets as well.  I know Sam the Osprey exchange them for fishes and all of the people you invite through the Adventurers Settlement package are happy to pay you tickets for a well cooked meal after you have made up a menu!

The uses of tickets are endless!  All of us have wares for sell in exchange for them and of course the material loan from Jess Inc. will be paid off with them as well.

Hi there human!  This is Rigg the Racoon.  I've sensed you have gotten yourselves some Miles Tickets. (How? Oh don't worry about that!) The point is that I am a good business partner of Jess and I love you make you an offer: just rub some miles tickets in a crafting table to make a market stand and I'll be right there you offer you all kinds of wares!

Do you want meats sourced from the finest farms? Ancient texts of enchanting to help your adventures? Or even some collection from Jess's dex that are too troublesome to obtain?  This all and more can be yours for the right amount of tix haha!
